<p><p>The opposing Primordial Dragons: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bahamut</strong>, of the Metallic Dragons (Good)</li>
<li><strong>Tiamat</strong>, of the Chromatic Dragons (Evil)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="the-age-of-dragons">The Age of Dragons</h5>
<p>Bahamut and Tiamat were the first of the Dragons, beings of immense divine magical energy that somehow attained physical forms in the world. </p>
<p>Both the Primordial Dragons created in their images further Dragons, the earliest of which are the Ancient Dragons, one of each Dragon Aspect. These Ancient dragons are the ancestors of all further dragons seen in the world to this day. The Dragonborn are the youngest descendants of the Primordial Dragons, and worship them as their Deities. </p>
<p>The Dragonborn dominated the world during this, their civilisation thriving as their influence and control spread across the lands - their military power centralised in the Citadels they built across the world.</p>
<p>Over time, unknown chaotic forces began to corrupt Tiamat and she grew greedy and resentful of sharing a position of power with her brother - driving her to try and kill him so that she would be able to rule the world as a single, all-powerful being. In the struggle between Bahamut and Tiamat, they were too equally matched and the confrontation continued for a century. During this time, the Dragonborn of Metallic and Chromatic kinds split into opposing factions, fighting for their direct Primordial ancestor. Citadels took up arms against one another, and the Dragonborn fell into civil war.</p>
<p>Bahamut realised he and his sister were too evenly matched for their fight to ever have a winner, and he saw the destruction the war was bringing to his people. He resolved himself to end the conflict at any cost, wrapping himself around Tiamat and untethering the restraints on his power, causing an explosion of magical energy and the destruction of himself and his sister - shattering their physical forms and returning them to their original state as beings of pure divine energy.</p>
<!-- This act caused a surge of raw magical energy to spread across the world, permeating deep into very fabric of existence. Dragonkind had always had access and the ability to weave magic, but it was now available to any who gained the knowledge, the skill, or had the aptitude to refine the dangerous raw magic into useful forms. -->
<p>After the removal of the physical presence of their Dragon Gods, the Dragonborn withdrew from their own conflicts and began an uneasy peace - but both sides had suffered massive losses from this civil war, and their civilisation would never recover from the division caused by the clash of their Gods. They would no longer hold dominion over the world, and withdrew to their great citadels to maintain the remnants of their splintered people.</p>
<h5 id="the-age-of-mortals">The Age of Mortals</h5>
<p>Vast majority of races still view Bahamut &amp; Tiamat as their dieties.</p>
<p>Elves do not worship any gods.</p>
<p>Humans of the Luxan Territories follow the Light Eternal, a diety that was unknown to this region of the world. It is followed by the Luxans as they were gifted the divine power to fight against the demons that constantly attack their native lands. It bestows additional power upon certain individuals it deems worthy of being its Champions - this is how Aasimar are created.</p>
<p>Many groups pray to different regional 'Hero' gods. Figures from history and legend who were deemed to have risen to godhood. There is little to no proof of these Hero Gods existing, yet religious groups have still grown in their names, and some followers have found themselves gifted with divine magical powers through their worship.</p>
