  Brainstorming
</h1>
<p><p>Bahamut &amp; Tiamat are the God Dragons, possessing immense power stemming from their divine souls.</p>
<p>Dragonkind have innate divine magic, due to their ancestry.</p>
<p>Tiamat became corrupted by the Ether, and saw dragonkind as the rightful rulers of the world. She directed her children to conquer the mortal races, and establish the Draconic Empire. </p>
<p>The Draconic Empire dominated the world, with the great Citadels acting as centres of power.</p>
<p>Bahamut became unsettled with Tiamat's cruelty and ruthlessness toward the mortal races. Realising that he must stop his sister he confronted Tiamat. Seeing that her brother was now against her, Tiamat attacked Bahamut, locking the two in mortal combat.</p>
<p>Eventually Bahamut realised he would be unable to defeat Tiamat, and so he sacrificed himself in a magical explosion to destroy them both.</p>
<!-- The followers of Bahamut (the metallic dragonkind) fled the Empire. -->
<p>The destruction of the God Dragons shattered their divine souls in a burst of magic that spread across the world, weakening the barrier between the Prime and the Ether.</p>
<p>The other races of the world now have access to magic, by tapping into the Ether. To do so is risky, as the chaotic forces of the Ether may become uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Mortals started to appear wielding their own divine souls, shards of the God Dragons. These individuals possessed immense innate magic, giving them the power to fight against the Dragonic Empire, and to slay the powerful dragons that subjugated them.</p>
<p>The mortal races, led by these newly risen heroes, overthrew their draconic overlords establishing their own independent lands and kindoms.</p>
<p>Dragonkind found itself reduced to a fraction of the power it once had. Many dragons were killed, the others having gone into hiding. The Dragonborn found themselves driven back to only a few remaining citadels.</p>
<p>A sect of the dragonborn still worshipping Tiamat weaved dark magic from the Ether in secret to create a weapon with which they would regain their power over the mortal races; the Orcs - an embodiment of the forces of chaos.</p>
<p>The orcs are unleashed upon the world, but the dragonborn soon realise they are incapable of controlling this weaponised race, and the orcs' rampage spreads - causing destruction everywhere.</p>
<p>The dragonborn suffer further losses at the hands of their uncontrollable weapon, and retreat to sealed themselves in the greatest of their fortresses: The Black Citadel.</p>
<p>The Orcs ran rampant over the other races of the world, inflicting huge losses on all - but widely-spread civilisation of Humankind suffers the greatest blow.</p>
<p>As it became clear this threat was too great for the races of the world to face alone, they all banded together to cull this existential threat - barely succeeding in doing so. </p>
<p>The Orc numbers were decimated, leaving behind only small groups scattered across the continent.</p>
