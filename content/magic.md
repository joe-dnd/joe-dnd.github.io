Magic is a complicated issue in the world.
The source of magic is unknown(?).

Rare individuals are born with a trait that grants them the ability to open themselves to inter-planar sources of energy, and channel it into desirable forms. The risks of magic use are many, and potentially severe. The aether - the source of the energy that causes magic - means that spellcasters do not typically have control over the source of their power, which means every time they cast a spell it is possible that the magic comes from more nefarious sources, such as infernal planes - which can draw attention to the material plane.

The aether is the immaterial space that exists between planes, facilitating the link between all dimensions.

Sorcerers have the most obvious of these traits, intuitively turning their own bodies into conduits of this extra-planar energy, and channeling it as they see fit. These people find themselves improving their ability to access this aspect of their being with greater ease over time, increasing the strength of magics they can perform. Sorcerers are the magic-users at greatest risk of becoming possessed by the beings of these other planes, due to the channeling of the magic energy through themselves.

Wizards, alternatively, learn through immense study the practice of creating small tears between planes, and then harnessing the energy that seeps through to performs wondrous spells. Wizards are not at as high of risk of possession, but are at risk of their planar tears becoming unwieldy and out of control, which can cause all manner of issues - from opening traversable portals from other planes (allowing anything on the other side to enter the material plane), to simply caused a flood of energy to burst forth, causing a magical explosion.

Warlocks have the clearest source of power of all. They have made deals with beings from other planes for the power, usually after they have a had a taste and want more directly from the source. 

Clerics perform their magics through the strength of their faith. There is no obvious source of the power given to clerics to wield, yet they are able to wield their faith as a weapon, granting them these magical abilities. Clerics do not view it as a form of magic, instead as divine miracles.

Paladins are typically those who were gifted their powers by a source in response to oath sworn or task set upon. The Luxan Templar found their power after throwing themselves into battle against evil forces, with no regard for their own safety.

Druids are the exception to the rule of magic in the world, drawing their energies from the natural world around them. They are the only spellcasters who do not look to other planes to grant them power - instead gathering strength from the elements themselves.

Most magic is viewed with suspicion by the majority of people, but certain schools are completely taboo such as Necromancy.

The Luxans completely forbid the use of all but Radiant magic, viewing all other types as a use of demonic energy.

The Vaalani (high) elves gain their magical prowess from the feywild, nurturing their connection to the other plane, and through it growing their access to arcane power. It is rumourer than the vaalani have grown addicted to the energies of the feywild.

The Vrukani (dark) elves are those who grew an insatiable hunger for the energy afforded to them by the fey connection, and eventually found that it is was not enough to satisfy their cravings. They opened themselves up to any and all sources of energy upon which to fill themselves with that power they had become addicted to, and as such draw on a variety of sources for their magics.

Tiefling spellcasters typically make use of their infernal bond to perform their magic.

Humans, Halflings, and Dwarfs use different sources. 
Freelander Humans typically look to druidic magic. 

Gnomes use their own innate connection to the feywild.

Duneidal (wood) elves rejected the dependence on the fey connection, and struck out on their own in the world to find a life that relies only upon the material plane. Some elves maintain some level of fey connection to access arcane magics, but are looked down upon by their brethren for it. Others focus on druidic magics.

The Goblin Empire heavily restricts magic only to those who have been licensed to do so for the purposes of the empire. Being caught practicing magic outside of these limits is a criminal offence. Magic is still taught in secret within certain areas of the empire.
