### Unexpected Fey Wanderers (Forest gnome)
Gnomes are native to feywild, and yet they are unexplainably able to pop up in the Material Plane from time to time. Gnomes are a rare sight, and even when seen its not unexpected for them to disappear not long after. They are extremely independent creatures, and barely take notice of the complexities of the world around them, instead choosing to focus on their immediate surroundings, moving from one moment to next, with no concern for consequence or future implications. Some people respond positively to the appearance of a gnome, seeing them as a source of good luck, and treat them warmly. Others do react quite as affectionately to sudden gnome in their lives, viewing them as destructive entities due to their carefree and impulsive personalities.

### Svirfneblin (Deep gnome)
The Svirfneblin are natives to the feydark - the feywild parallel of the underdark. They too appear in the Material Plane without any explanation - though specifically within the underdark. Somehow the duergar dwarves of the underdark have managed to come into contact with a large number of deep gnomes, and have turned them into slaves.
