## Goblinoid Empire - Goblins, Hobgoblins, Bugbears
Most of the continent is ruled by an imperial empire of goblinoids, ruled by
the goblin emperor in the capital of Grome. 

## Elven Desert Kingdom - High Elves
The elves live in a city built into the whithered husk of a massive tree trunk, in the centre of a vast desert. The elves live within this harse landscape due to it being the location at which the dimensional barrier between the Material Plane and the Feywild is at its weakest. The elves feel naturally drawn to the fey energy due to their ancestral roots there. The land is a desert as the Feywild is drawing energy from the Material Plane for its own growth, and this siphoning of life energy continues to spread, expanding the borders of the desert.

## Elven Mercenaries - Wood Elves
Elves that left the desert centuries ago, out of desire to experience more out of the world than just feeling the fey connection. They have established themselves in their homeland and defend it viciously. They do not partake in the typical forms of economics of a nation, instead earning gold by working as mercenaries for other nations or groups. Do not have a very developed civilisation, living nomadically.

## Elven Outcasts - Dark Elves
Elves that became addicted to the energy that the fey connection offered, but did not find it to be enough to satisfy them. This cabal of elves experimented with different methods of fulfilling their craving for magical energy, even going beyond the limitations of fey energy, pursuing different entities and sources. Cast out of the elven desert for breaching the laws of the kingdom, these elves continued their practices in the mountain they made their new home. Their continued abuse of magic caused a corruption in their bodies, turning their skin grey and their hair white, and in the earth of their lands, turning it to a blackened obsidian, and causing volcanic activity where before there was none. This eventually led to cataclysmic event, sundering their mountainous region off from the mainland into a new island.

## Human City States - Humans
Humans are not a dominant race in this continent. They exist mostly within settlements in the lands of the other kingdoms and empires, and must obey their laws. The only real footholds humankind has in this land are the few independent walled city states that manage to hold against the Goblin Empire and other factions.

## Human Religious Crusaders - Humans (including Aasimar)
One faction of humans believe they are the rightful rulers of this land, with this destiny bestowed upon them by the entity they worship, the Light Eternal. They spread the word of this religion, converting populaces that yearn to believe that humans have a higher place in this tough world. The areas that are controlled by this faction live by a strict religious code, upheld by the paladin order, who wear gleaming armour including full-head helmets, said to depict the face of their god, that they have sworn to never remove in public. The faction is governed by a council of clerics.

## Dwarven Mountain Holds and War Profiteers - Dwarves
The dwarves of these lands maintain great holds built into many mountains. These mountain holds are themselves connected by a vast network of tunnels, created and maintained by the dwarves within the underdark. 
The dwarves of these factions are left alone by the ever expanding Goblinoid Empire, as they act as arms dealers, supplying all factions looking to buy with their superior dwarvern product. The dwarves profit greatly from this, while managing to maintain their facade of neutrality - in truth they use this wealth to influence the world to advance their own interests.

## Secretive Halfling Gypsy Caravans - Halflings
After the halfings lost their homelands through goblinoid expansionism, the remaining population are left to roam the world in their ever-moving trading caravans, of which there are many in different regions. They survive by trading with any and all cities, towns, and villages they pass through. 
The halflings are rumoured to take part in a multitude of underhand dealings, including black market trading, thievery, and even assassinations.

## Draconic Remnants of an Ancient Civilisation - Dragonborn
There is only one remaining dragonborn citadel, which hosts the majority of the remaining dragonborn. The dragonborn used to be the primary species of this land, thousands of years ago, but now they are reduced to a fraction of their former glory, due to the growth of other races and factions in the world. The remnants of their old citadels are found throughout the world, abandoned and in ruins now, and sometimes now hosting a different faction who took up residence.
Dragonborn are an immortal race, unable to die of old age, but the birth of a new dragonborn is an extremely rare occurance. Centuries of war have had a heavy toll of the population numbers, and now the dragonborn have retreated to their last citadel to try and maintain what little they have left. Dragonborn are rarely seen outside of the lands immediately surrounding this citadel, therefore when one is seen they are viewed with suspicion of their motives.

## Gnomish Fey Wanderers - Gnomes
Gnomes are native to feywild, and yet they are unexplainably able to pop up in the Material Plane from time to time. Gnomes are a rare sight, and even when seen its not unexpected for them to disappear not long after. They are extremely independent creatures, and barely take notice of the complexities of the world around them, instead choosing to focus on their immediate surroundings, moving from one moment to next, with no concern for consequence or future implications.

## Humans with the Power to Resist - Tieflings
The human city state of **CITY_NAME** was almost overrun by the goblinoid legions, until the leader of the city made a bargain with an infernal being for the power to repel the invaders. The deal was successful, and the city drove back the goblinoids, but the cost was the great. The newfound power bestowed on every citizen changed them physically, growing horns and turning their skin shades of red. These half-demons continue to protect their city with fierce loyalty, reinforced by the bond every citizen now shares in this physical corruption. 

## Green Weapons of Mass Destruction - Orcs
Created by dragonborn magic in an attempt to create a force to maintain power in these lands, this experiment failed and created a rampaging race of war-hungry barbarians. The orcish race has no interest in civilisation or the control of territory - their only interest is constant warfare. Originally unleashed in vast numbers, this threat was reduced to only scattered tribes across the lands by all other races and factions fighting against this indiscriminate enemy. Yet, the orcs continue to grow their numbers back, and if the tribes were to rejoin they would once again be a great threat to the nations of the world.
