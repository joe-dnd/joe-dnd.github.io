### Duneidal - Elven Horse Nomads (Wood elf)
Elves that left the desert centuries ago, out of desire to experience more out of the world than just feeling the fey connection. They have established themselves in their homeland and defend it viciously. They do not partake in the typical forms of economics of a nation, instead earning gold by working as mercenaries for other nations or groups. Do not have a very developed civilisation, living nomadically, relying greatly on their relationship with their horses.
