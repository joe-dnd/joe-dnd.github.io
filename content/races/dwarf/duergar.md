### Grey dwarfs (Duergar dwarf)
The duergar are the most despised group of dwarves, typically found in the Underdark. They are most known on the surface world for their role in the capture and trading of slaves, including svirfneblin and lizardfolk. They make trips to the jungle lands of the lizardfolk, capturing and enslaving them to be brought back and sold to the Goblin Empire as forced labour.
