### Deep gnome
The Svirfneblin are natives to the feydark - the feywild parallel of the underdark. They too appear in the Material Plane without any explanation - though specifically within the underdark. Somehow the duergar dwarves of the underdark have managed to come into contact with a large number of deep gnomes, and have turned them into slaves.
