Elves are not native to his world, instead originating from ancestors in the Feywild.

As such, the High Elves do not worship any gods, instead focused on nurturing their link to the Feywild, and using that connection to enhance their natural magical abilities. As a species, the majority of High Elves make their home in the World Tree - a tree of fey origin that works a focus through which arcane magical energy seeps into the world from the Feywild, as the barrier between the two planes is at its weakest here. Due to this High Elves enjoy an innate magical ability, provided they maintain their fey connection.
Unknown to all but the highest echelons of Elven society are aware of the cost of this link to the Feywild - that the tree works both as the source of arcane magic in this world, and as a conduit through which the Feywild can drain the life energy from the world

Wood Elves trace their origins to a group of High Elves who splintered off when they discovered the secret cost of the access to fey magic, and found the Elven leaders were knowing perpetrators of this. They distrust the use of any magic not of natural origin (Druids, Rangers), and they work to prevent any further damage to nature by links to the Feywild from the Material Plane. Their ultimate goal to sever the fey connection with the destruction of the World Tree.
