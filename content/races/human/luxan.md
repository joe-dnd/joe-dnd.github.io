### Humans of the Luxan Order/Luxan Territories
#### Religious Crusaders/Protectors
One faction of humans believe they are the rightful rulers of this land, with this destiny bestowed upon them by the entity they worship, the Light Eternal. They spread the word of this religion, converting populaces that yearn to believe that humans have a higher place in this tough world. The areas that are controlled by this faction live by a strict religious code, upheld by the paladin order, who wear gleaming armour including full-head helmets, said to depict the face of their god, that they have sworn to never remove in public. The faction is not governed by any single body, instead following a set of beliefs passed down from generation to generation, and sticking to their laws out of devotion for their god.
The Luxans completely forbid the use of magic, other than radiant magic, as it is seen as a gateway for demonic energy. It is dealt with harshly.
