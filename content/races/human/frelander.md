### Humans of the Frelands
#### Independent Clans
Sparsely populated region of the world that holds one of the last remaining pockets of human settlements not under the control of the Goblin Empire, spared due to their their geographical location just outside the reach the Empire has the resources to expand to.
The people who live here live simple lives, living off the land in small villages. 
The people of these lands typically don't follow the known religions, instead following the druidic tradition of honouring the world itself.
