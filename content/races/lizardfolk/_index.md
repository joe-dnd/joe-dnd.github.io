### Slaves to the Goblin Empire (Lizardfolk)
The lizardfolk are not natives to this land, taken by force by the grey dwarfs, and sold as slaves to the Goblin Empire. Those who were not sold were kept as slaves by the grey dwarfs themselves.
The lizardfolk are treated poorly and not seen as equals of the same level of consciousness as other races, due to their different view of the world, but this is an unfair assessment. While lizardfolk do see the world in a simpler frame - driven by a set of basic instinctive principles - they are still fully aware of the world aroud them and are capable of understanding things other races cannot begin to comprehend.
