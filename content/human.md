### Independent City States (Human)
Humans are not a dominant race in this continent. They exist mostly within settlements in the lands of the other kingdoms and empires, and must obey their laws. The only real footholds humankind has in this land are the few independent walled city states that manage to hold against the Goblin Empire and other factions.

### Human Religious Crusaders (Humans/Aasimar)
One faction of humans believe they are the rightful rulers of this land, with this destiny bestowed upon them by the entity they worship, the Light Eternal. They spread the word of this religion, converting populaces that yearn to believe that humans have a higher place in this tough world. The areas that are controlled by this faction live by a strict religious code, upheld by the paladin order, who wear gleaming armour including full-head helmets, said to depict the face of their god, that they have sworn to never remove in public. The faction is governed by a council of clerics.


there will be maybe one small region of the world that still has small independent human settlements, which is less civilised and more barbarian-y/asterix and obelisk-y. these are probably going to independent mostly due to geography rather than 'repelling the goblins'.

then theres a lot of small human settlements within goblin lands, where humans might still be the biggest % of the population - but goblins are the ruling class. this could include some previously human cities that are now goblin owned. these humans are a bit more civilised compared to above.

then theres the super-religious faction of humans, where that Eternal Light religion has taken hold, and exists on the fringes of goblin empire, even starting to slowly reclaim some settlements that were taken by goblins, due to religious conversion and the goblin empire already being stretched out over such a large area

and then there's like the final hold-out of 'human' cities (now tiefling) - only possible due a demonic deal.

maybe some generic medieval human (small) city/kingdom thats also independent due to geographical reasons, like winterfell/the north in GoT, to cover that base

i think that gives a decent variety to human cultures, so any type of character someone wants to make has an easy 'default' option of where someone with particular characteristics might be from
