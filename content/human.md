### Luxans - Religious Crusaders/Protectors ('Luxan' Human/Aasimar)
One faction of humans believe they are the rightful rulers of this land, with this destiny bestowed upon them by the entity they worship, the Light Eternal. They spread the word of this religion, converting populaces that yearn to believe that humans have a higher place in this tough world. The areas that are controlled by this faction live by a strict religious code, upheld by the paladin order, who wear gleaming armour including full-head helmets, said to depict the face of their god, that they have sworn to never remove in public. The faction is not governed by any single body, instead following a set of beliefs passed down from generation to generation, and sticking to their laws out of devotion for their god.
The Luxans completely forbid the use of magic, other than radiant magic, as it is seen as a gateway for demonic energy. It is dealt with harshly.

### The Frelands ('Frelander' Human)
Sparsely populated region of the world that holds one of the last remaining pockets of human settlements not under the control of the Goblin Empire, spared due to their their geographical location just outside the reach the Empire has the resources to expand to.
The people who live here live simple lives, living off the land in small villages. 
The people of these lands typically don't follow the known religions, instead following the druidic tradition of honouring the world itself.

### Goblin Empire Provincials (Human)
The vast majority of human settlements fall within the limits of the Goblin Empire, and as such they are subjects of the Goblin Emperor. These people do not typically have the full rights of citizenship that a goblinoid has access to. Only a few select non-goblinoids have climbed high enough in society to have been honoured with citizenship - and those people are typically met with suspicion from others.
Humans are found across the entire stretch of the Goblin Empire - from primarily human population villages at the outskirts to being minorities within the great goblinoid city of Grome. No matter how big of a population percentage humans make up in the settlement in which they live, they are always viewed as 2nd class in comparison to a goblinoid.

### Kingdom of Calden ('Caldenian' Human)
The kingdom of Calden is a small fief controlled by the King Teodric. It is centred around the castle town of Westkeep, and has a hands-off approach to the lands under it's control, requiring only taxes from the its towns and men for its army when requested.

there will be maybe one small region of the world that still has small independent human settlements, which is less civilised and more barbarian-y/asterix and obelisk-y. these are probably going to independent mostly due to geography rather than 'repelling the goblins'.

then theres a lot of small human settlements within goblin lands, where humans might still be the biggest % of the population - but goblins are the ruling class. this could include some previously human cities that are now goblin owned. these humans are a bit more civilised compared to above.

then theres the super-religious faction of humans, where that Eternal Light religion has taken hold, and exists on the fringes of goblin empire, even starting to slowly reclaim some settlements that were taken by goblins, due to religious conversion and the goblin empire already being stretched out over such a large area

and then there's like the final hold-out of 'human' cities (now tiefling) - only possible due a demonic deal.

maybe some generic medieval human (small) city/kingdom thats also independent due to geographical reasons, like winterfell/the north in GoT, to cover that base

i think that gives a decent variety to human cultures, so any type of character someone wants to make has an easy 'default' option of where someone with particular characteristics might be from
