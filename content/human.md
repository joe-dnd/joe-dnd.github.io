### Independent City States (Human)
Humans are not a dominant race in this continent. They exist mostly within settlements in the lands of the other kingdoms and empires, and must obey their laws. The only real footholds humankind has in this land are the few independent walled city states that manage to hold against the Goblin Empire and other factions.

### Human Religious Crusaders (Humans/Aasimar)
One faction of humans believe they are the rightful rulers of this land, with this destiny bestowed upon them by the entity they worship, the Light Eternal. They spread the word of this religion, converting populaces that yearn to believe that humans have a higher place in this tough world. The areas that are controlled by this faction live by a strict religious code, upheld by the paladin order, who wear gleaming armour including full-head helmets, said to depict the face of their god, that they have sworn to never remove in public. The faction is governed by a council of clerics.
