There are 3 great dwarven cities built into the mountains across the lands, the greatest of which is Hvardor Hold, the other two being Kordrumn and Avalorn.
There are also the dwarves of the seafaring port-city of Anchoridge.

### Hvardorian dwarves (Hill/Mountain dwarf)
The House of Hvardor is the wealthiest of the dwarf nations, ruled by the Hvardor dynasty, with its great Hold built into the towering _____ Mountain. The dwarves of this nation do not mind being ruled by a inherited ruling class, due to the stability and prosperity they have managed to bring to the population. The House of Hvardor is the owner the Iron Bank, the biggest source of wealth for any nation in the world who wish to borrow. The Hvardor Hold maintains a neutral stance in politics between other nations, and keeps up an image of having no agenda of it's own.

### Kordrumnan dwarves (Hill/Duergar dwarf)
The nation of Kordrumn are known as the best smiths in all the lands, based in their city built into the _____ Mountains. These dwarves manufacture and supply their superior dwarven weapons and armor to all factions with the gold to buy.  Kordrumn is left alone by the expansive Goblinoid Empire, due to it's critical role as an arms dealer. The dwarves of Kordrumn profit greatly from this - and manage to maintain their own facade of neutrality. Kordrumn has built and maintains a vast network of tunnels through the underdark connection their capital with its many ports and trading towns - they have even gone as far as employing the use of some Duergar clans in the construction and maintainence of these routes.

### Avalornian dwarves (Mountain dwarf)
The legends of the shield dwarves of Avalorn are known by many. These dwarves are known for their military culture, in which all dwarves are trained for combat from the age of 10. Fiercely independent, these dwarves do not take a suspected insult lightly, and often choose battle as the preferred course of action over diplomacy. A nation of disciplined warriors, who go about their lives as any commoner would - but should their people be threatened they will put down their tools and pick up their weapons, ready to fight. The dwarves of Avalorn show no sense of affection for the Goblinoid Empire, and have no active potical relations, maintaining a fragile implied truce as long as they are not threatened themselves.

### Anchoridge dwarves (Sea dwarf)
The port-city of Anchoridge is a marvel of haphazard construction. The city is built on a cliff edge, extending from the top of the cliff down to its constructed harbour at its base. The largest of all ports in the world, Anchoridge is populated with a wide variety of creatures from lands stretching far and wide - but it is the native home to the Sea Dwarves. These dwarves are born and bred sailors, sometimes feeling more at home on the deck of ship than on land. Anchoridge is another city that represents the dwarven penchant for independence, left alone due to its key role in intercontinental trade.
