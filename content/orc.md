### Green Weapons of Mass Destruction (Orc) 
Created by dragonborn (or goblinoid?) magic in an attempt to create a force to maintain power in these lands, this experiment failed and created a rampaging race of war-hungry barbarians. The orcish race has no interest in civilisation or the control of territory - their only interest is constant warfare. Originally unleashed in vast numbers, this threat was reduced to only scattered tribes across the lands by all other races and factions fighting against this indiscriminate enemy. Yet, the orcs continue to grow their numbers back, and if the tribes were to rejoin they would once again be a great threat to the nations of the world.
