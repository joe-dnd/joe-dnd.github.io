### Secretive Hin Gypsy Caravans - (Lightfoot/Stout Halfling)
The Hin are a dimunitive race of gypsy-folk who roam the world in their travelling caravans, rarely stopping in one area for long. The Hin are referred to by most other races as Halflings. 

The Hin survive by trading with any and all cities, towns, and villages they pass through. The different Hin caravans display a variety of different cultures - but all share the trait of transcience. There are rumours that the Halflings maintain a secret network of black market trading, thievery, and assassination services.
