# The First Age
## The Age of Dragons

Dragonborn civilization dominates the world with their innate magic, as descendants of the World Dragons: Bahamut & Tiamat.

The dragonborn maintain control the over the other races of the world, ruling from their great Citadels.

...

The Elves discover the World Tree, and through it they forge the Fey Connection, gaining access to their own source of innate magic. Using this newfound power, the Elves liberate themselves from their Dragonborn rulers, and become an independent kingdom.

...

The Dwarves have established the three great dwarven city states: The depths of Hvardor Hold, the peaks of Avalorn, and the largest of the three: the mountain fortress of Kordrumn.

...

Humankind has an insignificant presence in the world at this time, living in tribes in the far north of the continent only focused on survival.

...

Tiamat is corrupted. Bahamut sacrifices himself to destroy her. This results in a surge of magical energy throughout the world, making magic available to all races.


# The Second Age
## The Age of Heroes

The magical surge in the world has caused the appearance of great heroes among the mortal races.

...

Humankind increases massively in population, and begins to spread out over the continent - growing in power and influence, as the Heroic figures that emerged from their race lead them to victory in battles against Dragonkind.

...

Dragonborn influence decays, as they no longer have the advantage of magic over the other races.

...

The Elves keep to themselves in their desert kingdom, continuing to feed off of their Fey Connection. During this age, a sect of elves became addicted to the magic and sought stronger sources to satisfy themselves, leading to their expulsion from the elvish kingdom for the dark methods they undertook to achieve this - these elves became known as Dark Elves.

... 

Dwarves continue to keep to their three great cities, focusing on their craft, trade, and commerce.

### The Extinction War

The dragonborn who still worshipped Tiamat, with the goal of regaining their lost influence and power in the world, weaved magic in secret to create a weapon of mass destruction: Orcs.

The orcs are unleashed upon the world, but the dragonborn soon realise they are incapable of controlling this weaponised race, and the orcs' rampage spreads - causing destruction everywhere.

...

The dragonborn of Tiamat - seeing what they've caused - retreat and sealed themselves in their great citadels.

...

The Orcs ran rampant over the other races of the world, inflicting huge losses on all - but widely-spread civilisation of Humankind suffers the greatest blow.

...

As it became clear this threat was too great for the races of the world to face alone, they all banded together to cull this existential threat - barely succeeding in doing so. 

The Orc numbers were decimated, leaving behind only small groups scattered across the continent.


# The Third Age
## The Age of Strife

In the aftermath of the war, Human civilisation had suffered massive damage - their numbers greatly reduced, and their heroes having sacrificed themselves for the cause. Humankind would no longer be a dominant force in the world, and what remained of their civilisation declined rapidly.

...

The dwarves also suffered a significant loss, as one of their great cities - the mountain fortress of Kordrumn - fell to the orcs. The remaining population of dwarves who lived in the city were scattered out across the continent as refuges.

...

The elven city built into the World Tree was relatively unscathed by the war, as it was surrounded by a massive expanse of desert.

It is during this time that a group of elvish separatists renounced their own fey connection and left the elvish kingdom, having discovered the damage being caused to the natural world as the World Tree siphoned life from the life in the environment surrounding it in order to maintain the link to the Feywild. These elves chose to focus on their connection to nature rather than feed off of the energy from another plane - and rejected any forms of unnatural magic - becoming known as Wood Elves.

...

Centuries after the Extinction War, and well into the decline of the mortal races of the world, the Goblinoids arrived on the continent. Their militaristic culture and technological advancement - achieved through widespread magic use - allowed for them to sweep through much of the continent, establishing the Goblin Empire, headed by their Emperor based in the the capital city of Gome. 

The goblinoids took control of all the settlements inside the territory they gained, and the humans who lived there came to accept their rulers.

...

The Goblin Empire continues to expand into the continent.
The Dwarves maintain their two remaining city-states.
The Frelander humans of the north fight to hold onto their fragile independence.
The High Elves seclude themselves in their city hidden in the vast golden desert, while the Wood Elves strike out on their own to both live with nature and protect it.
