## Poisoner's Kit
#### Create Poison
* Any poison you have identified can be made.
* Identify a poison's ingredients by passing a DC 15 Medicine or Nature check.
* Requires 8 hours per tier to make a poison.
* Uses ingredients that cost half the price of the poison.
* Upon completion of time investment, a poisoner skill check is made:
    - Role a pure <b>1d20</b>, applying Poisoner's Kit proficiency.
    - **On 20 or more**, you manage to create an extremely potent poison, causing all Saving Throws triggered by it to be made with Disadvantage.
    - **On 6 to 19**, you succeed normally.
    - **On 4 to 5**, DM rolls on a table of random effects which will apply when the poison is used. Effect is idenfiable by a DC 20 Medicine or Nature check.
    - **On 1 or less**, you fail in creating a poison.
