## Alchemist's Supplies
#### Create Potion
* Any potion you have identified or drank before can be made.
* Identify a potion's ingredients by passing a DC 15 Arcana check.
* Requires 1 day spent per tier to attempt to make a potion.
* Uses ingredients that cost half the price of the potion.
* Upon completion of time investment, an alchemy skill check is made:
    - Roll an <b>arcana check</b>, applying Alchemist's Supplies proficiency.
    - **On 25+ or natural 20**, you manage to get a high yield, doubling the number of potions created.
    - **On 11 to 24**, you succeed normally.
    - **On 2 to 10**, DM rolls on a table of random effects which will apply when the potion is used. Effect is identifiable by a DC 20 Arcana check.
    - **On a natural 1**, you fail in creating a potion.
