## Alchemist's Supplies
#### Create Potion
* Any potion you have identified or drank before can be made.
* Identify a potion's ingredients by passing a DC 15 Arcana check.
* Requires 8 hours per tier to make a potion.
* Uses ingredients that cost half the price of the potion.
* Upon completion of time investment, an alchemy skill check is made:
    - Roll a pure <b>1d20</b>, applying Alchemist's Supplies proficiency.
    - **On 20 or more**, you manage to get a high yield, doubling the number of potions created.
    - **On 6 to 19**, you succeed normally.
    - **On 2 to 5**, DM rolls on a table of random effects which will apply when the potion is used. Effect is identifiable by a DC 20 Arcana check.
    - **On 1 or less**, you fail in creating a potion.
