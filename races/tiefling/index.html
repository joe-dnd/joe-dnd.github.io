<p>The human city state of Sarovel was almost overrun by the goblinoid legions, until the leader of the city made a bargain with an infernal being for the power to repel the invaders. The deal was successful, and the city drove back the goblinoids, but the cost was the great. The newfound power bestowed on every citizen changed them physically, growing horns and turning their skin shades of red. These half-demons continue to protect their city with fierce loyalty, reinforced by the bond every citizen now shares in this physical corruption. </p>
<p>The Crimson Company are the private army of Sarovel, and they also work as a mercenaries for hire, bringing gold into the city. The group has a widespread reputation, as well as rumours and legends spread of what the demonic-looking mercenaries do to those whom they defeat in battle.</p>
