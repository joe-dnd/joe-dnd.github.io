  Wood Elf
</h1>
<p><h3 id="elven-horse-nomads-wood-elf">Elven Horse Nomads (Wood elf)</h3>
<p>Elves that left the desert centuries ago, out of desire to experience more out of the world than just feeling the fey connection. They have established themselves in their homeland and defend it viciously. They do not partake in the typical forms of economics of a nation, instead earning gold by working as mercenaries for other nations or groups. Do not have a very developed civilisation, living nomadically, relying greatly on their relationship with their horses.</p>
<h4 id="rewrite">Rewrite?</h4>
<p>Wood elves are those who rejected their fey ancestry instead choosing to focus on the energy of this world in the material plane. They resent their High Elf cousins for allowing so much damage to be done to their world in pursuit of fostering the connection to the feywild. The wood elves have a strict code of chivalry, and do not have gods beyond the earthmother - the world itself. The Duunedal druidic knights are an order than seeks to prevent further damage being caused to the world by the antics of the fey.</p>
