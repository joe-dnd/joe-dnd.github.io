<p>Elves that became addicted to the energy that the fey connection offered, but did not find it to be enough to satisfy them. This cabal of elves experimented with different methods of fulfilling their craving for magical energy, even going beyond the limitations of fey energy, pursuing different entities and sources. Cast out of the elven desert for breaching the laws of the kingdom, these elves continued their practices in the mountain they made their new home. Their continued abuse of magic caused a corruption in their bodies, turning their skin grey and their hair white, and in the earth of their lands, turning it to a blackened obsidian, and causing volcanic activity where before there was none. This eventually led to cataclysmic event, sundering their mountainous region off from the mainland into a new island.</p>
<p>The Vruukani are different from their elven cousins in that they are a highly religious and cultish society. They revere the beings from which they are granted power as their gods, and as such have many. This splintering of religious belief has caused the existance of many rivalling factions to arise, each striving to further the aims of their god.</p>
