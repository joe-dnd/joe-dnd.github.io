  High Elf
</h1>
<p><h3 id="elven-desert-kingdom-high-elf">Elven Desert Kingdom (High elf))</h3>
<p>The elves live in a city built into the whithered husk of a massive tree trunk, in the centre of a vast desert. The elves live within this harse landscape due to it being the location at which the dimensional barrier between the Material Plane and the Feywild is at its weakest. The elves feel naturally drawn to the fey energy due to their ancestral roots there. The land is a desert as the Feywild is drawing energy from the Material Plane for its own growth, and this siphoning of life energy continues to spread, expanding the borders of the desert.</p>
<p>There is no religion among high elves, and thus Paladins and Clerics are exceedingly rare. Instead, the Vaalani focus on the fey energies and the magics they can weave with them. </p>
