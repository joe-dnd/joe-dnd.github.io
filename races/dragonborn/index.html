<p>There is only one remaining dragonborn citadel, which hosts the majority of the remaining dragonborn. The dragonborn used to be the primary species of this land, thousands of years ago, but now they are reduced to a fraction of their former glory, due to the growth of other races and factions in the world. The remnants of their old citadels are found throughout the world, abandoned and in ruins now, and sometimes now hosting a different faction who took up residence.
Dragonborn are an immortal race, unable to die of old age, but the birth of a new dragonborn is an extremely rare occurance. Centuries of war have had a heavy toll of the population numbers, and now the dragonborn have retreated to their last citadel to try and maintain what little they have left. Dragonborn are rarely seen outside of the lands immediately surrounding this citadel, therefore when one is seen they are viewed with suspicion of their motives.</p>
