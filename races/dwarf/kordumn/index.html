<p>The nation of Kordrumn are known as the best smiths in all the lands, based in their city built into the _____ Mountains. These dwarves manufacture and supply their superior dwarven weapons and armor to all factions with the gold to buy.  Kordrumn is left alone by the expansive Goblinoid Empire, due to it's critical role as an arms dealer. The dwarves of Kordrumn profit greatly from this - and manage to maintain their own facade of neutrality. Kordrumn has built and maintains a vast network of tunnels through the underdark connection their capital with its many ports and trading towns - they have even gone as far as employing the use of some Duergar clans in the construction and maintainence of these routes.</p>
