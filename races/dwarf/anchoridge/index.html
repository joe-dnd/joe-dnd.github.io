<p><h3 id="anchoridge-dwarves-sea-dwarf">Anchoridge dwarves (Sea dwarf)</h3>
<p>The port-city of Anchoridge is a marvel of haphazard construction. The city is built on a cliff edge, extending from the top of the cliff down to its constructed harbour at its base. The largest of all ports in the world, Anchoridge is populated with a wide variety of creatures from lands stretching far and wide - but it is the native home to the Sea Dwarves. These dwarves are born and bred sailors, sometimes feeling more at home on the deck of ship than on land. Anchoridge is another city that represents the dwarven penchant for independence, left alone due to its key role in intercontinental trade.</p>
