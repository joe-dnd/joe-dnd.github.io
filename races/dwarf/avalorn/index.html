<p><h3 id="avalorn-dwarves-mountain-dwarf">Avalorn dwarves (Mountain dwarf)</h3>
<p>The legends of the shield dwarves of Avalorn are known by many. These dwarves are known for their military culture, in which all dwarves are trained for combat from the age of 10. Fiercely independent, these dwarves do not take a suspected insult lightly, and often choose battle as the preferred course of action over diplomacy. A nation of disciplined warriors, who go about their lives as any commoner would - but should their people be threatened they will put down their tools and pick up their weapons, ready to fight. The dwarves of Avalorn show no sense of affection for the Goblinoid Empire, and have no active potical relations, maintaining a fragile implied truce as long as they are not threatened themselves.</p>
