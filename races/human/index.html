<p><p>In ancient times the humans were the dominant species of this continent, until either discord or calamity caused each of the great human cities to fall into ruin. Centuries passed, with the humans returning back to a much more simnple, rural existance, until the collective memory of the great heights of the human civilisations faded, lost to history. Long after this, the Goblin Empire spread throughout the land, and took into its control the majority of human settlements. Some humans are holdouts from the empire, while others actively work to try and reinstate what they see as the humans right to rule this land. </p>
<h2 id="additional-information">Additional information</h2>
<p>There will be maybe one small region of the world that still has small independent human settlements, which is less civilised and more barbarian-y/asterix and obelisk-y. these are probably going to independent mostly due to geography rather than 'repelling the goblins'.</p>
<p>Then theres a lot of small human settlements within goblin lands, where humans might still be the biggest % of the population - but goblins are the ruling class. this could include some previously human cities that are now goblin owned. these humans are a bit more civilised compared to above.</p>
<p>Then theres the super-religious faction of humans, where that Eternal Light religion has taken hold, and exists on the fringes of goblin empire, even starting to slowly reclaim some settlements that were taken by goblins, due to religious conversion and the goblin empire already being stretched out over such a large area</p>
<p>And then there's like the final hold-out of 'human' cities (now tiefling) - only possible due a demonic deal.</p>
<p>Maybe some generic medieval human (small) city/kingdom thats also independent due to geographical reasons, like winterfell/the north in GoT, to cover that base</p>
<p>I think that gives a decent variety to human cultures, so any type of character someone wants to make has an easy 'default' option of where someone with particular characteristics might be from</p>
