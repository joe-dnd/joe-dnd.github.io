<p>The vast majority of human settlements fall within the limits of the Goblin Empire, and as such they are subjects of the Goblin Emperor. These people do not typically have the full rights of citizenship that a goblinoid has access to. Only a few select non-goblinoids have climbed high enough in society to have been honoured with citizenship - and those people are typically met with suspicion from others.
Humans are found across the entire stretch of the Goblin Empire - from primarily human population villages at the outskirts to being minorities within the great goblinoid city of Grome. No matter how big of a population percentage humans make up in the settlement in which they live, they are always viewed as 2nd class in comparison to a goblinoid.</p>
